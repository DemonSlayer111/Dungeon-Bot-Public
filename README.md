# Dungeon Bot
This repository serves to help users understand how a discord bot works and to document some of the development history of Dungeon Bot: https://dungeons.bot

While used in the past, this code is no longer representative of the code deployed on the live version of Dungeon Bot and only serves as an example. 

No support will be given and code changes will not be merged into the repository.
